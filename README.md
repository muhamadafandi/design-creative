# design-creative
Thrive on ambitious challenges and goals; Its greatest strength is the ability to use skills and talents to solve problems and enable simple solutions to improve any workspace. Thus commitment and enthusiasm in various fields of science, research and arts / media. I am an expert in many media such as; digital art, acrylic painting, watercolor painting, graphite drawing, chalk art, paper clay sculpture, oil painting, crafts, etc. I was mostly absent, taking multiple art options at MSU Denver while pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Natural, Historical, and Social Analysis.
